### Hi there 👋

<!--
**AndrewFawcet/AndrewFawcet** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning how to use github
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects
- 🏃 Fun fact: I like a jog on the weekends, and massive bowls of granola.
